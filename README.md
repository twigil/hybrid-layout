Hybrid bilingual dvorak+йцукен keyboard layout
=============

Okay, this has to be explained somehow.

Recently I've switched to changing input languages with CapsLock. Windows does not support this by default, so I had to use PuntoSwitcher for this setting. But then another problem arised: I wanted the layout to be changed globally, which is not supported in Windows as well. So I ran into [one superuser thread](http://superuser.com/questions/13324/switching-keyboard-layout-in-windows-globally) and found an answer about creating a custom keyboard layout as a solution (yes, as they say there, it is really a horrible hack).

Having the above, I've created such layout for myself. I've been studying dvorak layout for some time at that moment, so if CapsLock is off, the layout is йцукен, and with CapsLock on it's dvorak. All kb shortcuts are dvorak based as well. It may still have some bugs, however (as well as my English here is not perfect for sure), so I'll be happy to get any feedback (little hope, I know). Thanks to [dbuzz](https://github.com/dbuzz) for testing.
